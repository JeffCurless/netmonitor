# NetMonitor

A GUI based network and bluetooth monitor using a Raspberry PI Pico and a Pimornoni DISPLAY_PACK_2


## Outstanding work
- [ ] Modify the wifi code to constantly monitor for addresses much like the bluetooth module does
- [ ] Comment all of the display code
- [ ] Try to determine why the battery code works sometimes and not others
- [ ] Overall cleanup of code

> [!NOTE]
> This code is supported on an standard PICO, with a Pimoroni DISPLAY_PACK_2 attached.
